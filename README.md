# Scorekeeper Exercise

## Introduction

For this assignment, the aim was to create a score keeper widget for a game of ping pong. It should allow you to set the number of wins required, use buttons to increase the wins for a player, indicate when one player has won the required number of games and then chnage the score colours and disable the buttons, and then finally a buttom to reset the scores. We had to do the logic using Javascript and do the structure and styling using the **Bulma** CSS framework. Check out the Bulma documentation [here] (https://bulma.io/documentation/).

## Comments

This was quite a tough project and an excellent learning experience that took me the best part of a day to complete. I found the Javascript logic not too bad to work out and get functioning quite quickly, but I did spend a bit of time reorganizing the code and making it cleaner. I really liked the challenge of having to work with a new CSS framework in Bulma, which I have never used before, and work out from the documentation its syntax and how it works. I liked it and found that compared to Bootstrap it was more lightweight and the syntax was much more intuitive. The documentation was decent but wasn't anywhere near as in-depth or have as many features and examples as Bootstrap.
